  "about": [
    "I first fell into the coding rabbit hole in 1998, and that curiosity has never left me. From early desktop apps to building complex software for global leaders like Lectra, my journey has always been about one thing: making technology work better for people.",
    "These days, I’m focused on the frontier of web performance. I love exploring modern tools like Zig and WebAssembly to bring near-native speed to the browser. My specialty is turning heavy, complex data into smooth, meaningful experiences—whether I’m architecting industrial solutions or crafting high-performance tools for the trail running community.",
    "When I’m away from my desk, you’ll find me road or trail running, enjoying life with my wife and daughter, or getting lost in my favorite music."
